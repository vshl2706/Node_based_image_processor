# Node-based Image Processor

A C++ desktop application that allows users to manipulate images through a visual, node-based interface. Similar to software like Substance Designer, this tool provides a flexible framework for building image processing workflows by connecting different types of processing nodes.

## Features

- **Node-based Interface**: Users can create, connect, and manage nodes to define their image processing pipeline.
- **Image Input/Output Nodes**: Input and output image handling to bring images into the system and export the final result.
- **Customizable Node System**: Nodes can be added for different image manipulations such as filters, transformations, and adjustments.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: An intuitive drag-and-drop interface for managing nodes and connections between them.
- **Extendable Framework**: Easily add new node types or extend the system with custom functionality.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following directories:

- `include/` — Contains header files for core components like nodes, connections, and the main window.
- `src/` — Contains the implementation files for the core components and logic of the image processor.
